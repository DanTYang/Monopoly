# Monopoly

This is a repository for replicating Monopoly in Java.

## Motivation

Monopoly is a reasonably complex board game, we wanted to challenge our CS knowledge and create Monopoly in a variety of languages including **Python**, **JavaScript**, and **Java**.

## How it Works

We've fragmented our application into classes that replicate Monopoly gameplay features. As of now, we've only completed these classes in **Java**, but we intend on replicating the behavior in other languages.

- ✅ `Card.java`
  - ✅ `CommunityChests.java`
  - ✅ `DiceRoller.java`
- ✅ `Player.java`
- ✅ `Property.java`
- ✅ `Trade.java`

### Card
This is an abstract class for `CommunityChest.java` and `DiceRoller.java`.

#### Community Chests
  
#### Dice Roller
