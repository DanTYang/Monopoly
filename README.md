# Monopoly

This is a repository for replicating Monopoly in Java.

### Motivation

Monopoly is a reasonably complex board game, we wanted to challenge our CS knowledge and create Monopoly in a variety of languages including **Python**, **JavaScript**, and **Java**.

### How it Works

We've fragmented our application into a classes that replicate certain function in monopoly.

- Card
- Community Chests
- Dice Roller
- Player

- Trade
