# Monopoly
This is a repository for replicating Monopoly in Java.

## Motivation
Monopoly is a reasonably complex board game, we wanted to challenge our CS knowledge and create Monopoly in a variety of languages including **Python**, **JavaScript**, and **Java**.

## What is the Setup?
We've fragmented our application into classes that replicate Monopoly gameplay features. As of now, we've only completed these classes in **Java**, but we intend on replicating the behavior in other languages.

- ⛔️`Card.java`
  - ✅ `CommunityChests.java`
  - ✅ `Chance.java`
- ✅ `DiceRoller.java`
- ✅ `Player.java`
- ✅ `Property.java`
- ✅ `Trade.java`

### Card
This is an abstract class for `CommunityChest.java` and `DiceRoller.java`.

#### Community Chests
Manually adds all of the Community Chest Cards, their names, their descriptions, and assigns each an index value for lookup and card implementation.

#### Dice Roller
